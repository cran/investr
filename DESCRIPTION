Title: Inverse Estimation/Calibration Functions
Version: 1.4.2
Author: Brandon M. Greenwell
Maintainer: Brandon M. Greenwell <greenwell.brandon@gmail.com>
Description: Functions to facilitate inverse estimation (e.g., calibration) in
    linear, generalized linear, nonlinear, and (linear) mixed-effects models. A
    generic function is also provided for plotting fitted regression models with
    or without confidence/prediction bands that may be of use to the general
    user. For a general overview of these methods, see Greenwell and Schubert 
    Kabban (2014) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2014-009>.
